# **Eagle Track Backend**

**A backend API for the Eagle Track inventory management application.**

By **Chris Ndegwa**


## **Description**

Eagle Track Backend is a simple API built using **json-server** to support the **Eagle Track** inventory management app. This API provides endpoints to manage inventory items, including CRUD operations such as adding, editing, deleting, and fetching items.

The backend uses **CORS** to allow cross-origin requests and provides a mock database (`db.json`) for storing item data. This setup is ideal for local development or as a starting point for a more complex backend.

## **Features**

- **CRUD operations** for managing inventory items:
  - **GET**: Retrieve the list of items.
  - **POST**: Add a new item.
  - **PUT**: Update an existing item.
  - **DELETE**: Remove an item.
- **CORS enabled** for easy integration with frontend applications.
- **Custom logging** of requests for debugging and development purposes.
- **Simulated delay** in the `/items` route to test response handling.

## **How to Use**
